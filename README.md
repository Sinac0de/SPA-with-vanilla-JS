# <a name="important-note"></a>Important Note
* to make this project run currectly you need to first clone the project in a folder and run the server.js via node js and after that you need to go to localhost:5000 in your browser to see the result.
* or you can visit my other repository where I didn't use server.js in <a href="https://github.com/Sinac0de/SPA-REPO-Without-Server"> HERE</a>.
